# LinkedList Quiz

# Problem Statement
Given a linked list storing numbers, implement a function (linked_list_counter) that will count the occurence of each number and print it in the format [number] [count]\n
 
# Example
LinkedList: 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 7 -> NULL

Will produce output
2 1
3 2
4 1
5 2
7 1

# Criteria
- The order of the output doesn't matter
- Provided header must not be changed
- prints must be to stdout
- the linked list will be created in main and passed as an argument into your function, you do not need to construct it
- there will be no numbers with a size greater than an integer
- it is recommended that time complexity is O(n), time limit per test case is ten seconds

# Instructions
Implement the function and submit helper.c to respective gradescope assignment when complete. Make sure to test your program. There will be one test case and a makefile provided. Feel free to write your own as well.
